Linked List

1. Insert a node into Linked List at ith position recursively

2. Delete node at ith position from Linked list recursively

3. Implement code to swap two elements of a Linked List. (swap nodes
and not just their data)

4. Eliminate duplicates from a sorted linked list

5. Merge two sorted linked lists into one.

6. Find midpoint of a Linked List

7. Implement Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort and Merge Sort
using recursion.

8. Implement Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort without using
recursion.

9. Check if a linked list is a palindrome

10. Reverse Linked List a) Using recursion
b) Without using recursion

11. Arrange elements in a Linked List such that all even numbers are
placed after odd numbers.

12. Print a given linked list in reverse order. Tail first. You can’t change any pointer in the linked list.

13. Append the last n elements of a linked list to the front.
e.g. for 1→ 2→ 3 → 4 → 5 → 6→ null and n = 2 return 5→ 6→ 1→ 2→ 3 → 4 → null

14. Implement kReverse(int k) i.e. you reverse first K elements then reverse next K elements and join the linked list and so on.

3 → 4 → 5 → 2 → 6 → 1 → 9 for kreverse(3) becomes 
5 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 6 → 2→ 9
