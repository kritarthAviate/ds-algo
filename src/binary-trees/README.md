Binary Trees

1. Given a binary tree count all leaf nodes.

2. Given two trees check if they are structurally identically.

3. Given a Binary tree check if it is balanced i.e. depth of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by 1 or less.

4. Given a binary tree, remove all the leaves from the tree.

5. Given a binary tree print all nodes that don’t have a sibling.

6. Given a binary tree. Print the level order traversal, make sure each level start at a new line.

7. Given a binary tree. Print the zig zag order i.e. print level 1 from left to right, level 2 from right to left and so on. This means odd levels should get printed from left to right and even levels should be printed from right to left. Each level should be printed at a new line.

8. Given a Binary tree, write code to create a separate linked list for each level. You should return an array of linked lists.

9. Given preorder and inorder create the tree.

10. Given postorder and inorder create the tree.
Bonus :
Pretty Print a Binary tree. (Hint: Find the height of the tree first)


 
BST and Binary Trees 

1. Implement Binary Search tree class. It should have the following functions.

a. insert
b. remove 
c. search 
d. size
e. isEmpty

2. For each node in a binary search tree, create a new duplicate node, and insert the duplice as the left child of the original node.

3. Given a binary tree, check whether there are two nodes in it whose sum equals a given value.  

4. Find LCA(Lowest Common Ancestor) of two elements in a Binary Tree. Read about LCA if you are having doubts about the definition.
 
5. Find LCA of two elements in a BST.

6. Given a Binary tree find the largest BST subtree.

7. Replace each node with the sum of all greater nodes in a given BST

8. Given a binary tree and a number k, print out all root to leaf paths where the sum of all nodes value is same as the given number.

9. Given a tree and a node of tree, print all nodes which are at distance k from the given node.  

10. Given a binary search tree and a int s, find pair of nodes in the BST which sum s.

a. Find a solution for which time complexity is O(n) 
b. Find a solution which uses maximum O(log n) extra space.
