Stacks and Queues

1. Implement a Queue using two stacks a. MakeEnqueueefficient 
b. Make Dequeue efficient  

2. Implement a Stack using two queues a. Makepushefficient 
b. Make pop efficient  

3. Reverse a Queue using recursion  

4. Check for duplicate parenthesis in an expression e.g. ((a + b) +
((c+d))) has duplicate parenthesis  

5. Implement a class MinStack using the stack class we have already
built. It should support O(1) push, O(1) pop and O(1) getMinimum() functions, where getMinimum() returns the minimum element present in the stack. (Hint: You would need two stacks for doing this)  

6. The span si of a stock’s price on a certain day i is the maximum number of consecutive days (up to the current day) the price of the stock has been less than or equal to its price on day i. Given input array with all stock prices return the spans. We can do this using an array in O(n^2) time but stack can help us do it in O(n) time. Implement the array approach if you can’t find a solution using stack.
