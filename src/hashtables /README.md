Hashtables 

1. Given two arrays: arr1[0...m-1] and arr2[0...n-1]. Find whether arr2[] is a subset of arr1[] or not. Both the arrays are not sorted.

2. Write a function that takes a string S, and an integer value N, and returns whether or not the string S contains at most N different characters i.e. total N or less distinct characters. The character comparison should be case insensitive i.e. you should ignore their case.  
Example:  

a) Input –  S = "HelloWorld" N=6 
Output = false (string contains 7 different character which is > 6)

b)  Input –  S = "bbbaacdaccce" N=7 
Output = true (string contains 5 different character which <= 7)

3. Given an array of N integers print pair of elements which sum to X.
  
4. Given a $ terminated text, print frequency of words.  

5. You are given with an array of integer contain number in no particular order. Write a program find the longest possible sequence of consecutive numbers using the numbers from the array. Best solution takes O(n) time. E.g.

a. Input=[2,12,9,16,10,5,3,20,25,11,1,8,6] Output = [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
b. Input = [13, 23, 21, 19, 11, 17, 22] Output = [22,23]  

6. Given an unsorted array that may contain duplicates. Also given a number k which is smaller than size of array. Write a function that returns true if array contains duplicates within k distance.

Example:

Input: k = 3, arr[] = {2, 5, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5} 
Output: false  All duplicates are more than k distance away.

Input: k = 3, arr[] = {3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5} 
Output: true  3 is repeated at distance 2
