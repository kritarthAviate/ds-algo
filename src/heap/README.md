Heaps

1. Implement max and min Priority Queue using Heap  

2. Find k largest or k smallest elements in an array.  

3. Sort an almost sorted array. Each element is within k index of its final location.  

4. Merge k sorted arraylists into one(Using Heap)  

5. Write a class which implements following functions(Using
Heap)

Insert(int nextElement): I can insert numbers into your object using this function. It should run in O(logn) time, where n is the number of elements inserted so far.  

int median(): returns the median of the numbers inserted so far. Must work in O(1)  

void removeMedian(): Removes one or both medians from the object.
