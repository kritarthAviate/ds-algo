Strings


1. Take a String input from user and return a String that does not contain consecutive duplicates. For example, for input "aabccbaa" return "abcba".

2. Return highest occurring character in the String.

3. Sort an array of Strings based on length.

4. Reverse each word of a String. Eg “Welcome to Coding Ninjas”
reversed is – “emocleW ot gnidoC sajniN”

5. Reverse String wordwise. Eg “Welcome to Coding Ninjas” reversed is–
“Ninajs Coding to Welcome”

6. Write code to do basic string compression. e.g. Given aaabbccds print
out a3b2c2ds.

7. Given a string,find largest substring with no repetition i.e all unique characters. E.g - for string “abcdabceb” , answer will be “dabce”

8. Write a program to multiply 2D arrays A and B of dimensions NxL and
LxM respectively.

9. Rotate a 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise
E.g - Consider Array 

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

After rotating 90 degrees clockwise it will be - 

7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
