Arrays

1. Convert a decimal number to binary using array.

2. Find product of all numbers in an array.

3. Reverse an array. Same array should be reversed.

4. Print sum of all positive and negative numbers separately in
an array.

5. Given an array of integers A and an integer x. Find pairs of
elements in A, which sum to x.

6. Find the duplicate number in an array of size n with numbers
from 0 to n-2. Each number is present at least once.

7. In an array that contains duplicates, find the first non
repeating element.
E.g – input – [5,2,6,7,5,6,9] and output - 2

8. You are given two arrays. Find the sum of the two arrays and
put the result in another array.
E.g. if you are given [1,2,4] and [4,5,6] then output should be [5,8,0].

9. You are given with an array containing only 0’s and 1’s. Write a function to sort this array. Find a solution which scans the array only once.

10. Bubble sort. Insertion sort. Merge sort. Quick sort. Heap sort.

11. Given two arrays print their intersection.
a. Instead of printing write a function which returns their intersection.

12. Find second largest element in an array.

13. Given an array of integers A and an integer x. Find triplets of
elements in A which sum to x.

14. You are given with an array containing only 0’s, 1’s and 2’s. Write a
function to sort this array. Also find another solution which scans the
array once.

15. A sorted array has been rotated by some number k in clockwise
direction. Find k. E.g. Input: 5,6,1,2,3,4 Output: 2

16. Find equilibrium index of the array. Equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.

Eg:Input -7,1,5,2,-4,3,0
Output - 3 is an equilibrium index because: A[0] + A[1] + A[2] = A[4] + A[5] + A[6]

17. Given an array of integers, sort the array into a wave like array and return it. In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5 >=a6....
